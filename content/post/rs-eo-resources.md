With the increasing amount and availability of satellite Earth Observation data it's critical to know where to search for it and what suits best for the task at hands.
So to help with this I decided to create a minimal list with different types of resources in RS/EO (mostly focusing on optical sensors). In this page, it's possible to find data sources, learning materials, software and processing platforms among other potentially useful stuff. (Almost) everything in this directory is alphabetically listed so I am not organizing things according to my taste or preferences :wink:

Check it out here: [link](http://joaogoncalves.cc/Remote-Sensing-Earth-Observation-directory/)

I am certain that important resources or references are missing so let me know if you have suggestions to include here.
