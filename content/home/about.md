# About me

<div style="text-align:justify">

I am broad spectrum ecologist working on integrative approaches to investigate and monitor biodiversity patterns and spatiotemporal dynamics across multiple levels, scales and facets (composition, structure and function). For accomplishing this, I am looking for innovative ways to combine satellite remotely sensed Earth Observations, models and <em>in situ</em> data (among other sources). I am applying this combo to analyze ecosystem functions and linkages to ecological processes, species distributions and diversity, functional connectivity, wildifire disturbances and post-fire recovery as well as systems resilience. Ultimately, I hope to contribute for <em>'next-generation'</em> biodiversity monitoring systems for a better and safer Earth! <br />🌍 👍 🛰️
