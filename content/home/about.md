# About me

<div style="text-align:justify">

I am broad spectrum ecologist working on integrative approaches to investigate and monitor biodiversity patterns and their changes across multiple levels (from genes to landscapes), multiple scales (from local to regional) and facets (composition, structure and function). For accomplishing this, I am looking for innovative ways to combine satellite remotely sensed Earth Observations, models and <em>in situ</em> data (among other sources). I am applying this combo to analyze ecosystem functions and linkages to ecological processes related to species distributions, habitat suitability and diversity, functional connectivity, wildifires impact and post-fire recovery, biological invasions and systems resilience. Ultimately, I hope to contribute for <em>'next-generation'</em> biodiversity monitoring systems for a better and safer Earth! <br />üåç üëç üõ∞Ô∏è
