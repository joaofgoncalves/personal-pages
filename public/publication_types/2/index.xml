      <description>Full abstract Wildfires constitute an important threat to human lives and livelihoods worldwide, as well as a major ecological disturbance. However, available wildfire databases often provide incomplete or inaccurate information, namely regarding the timing and extension of fire events. In this study, we described a generic framework to compare, rank and combine multiple remotely-sensed indicators of wildfire disturbances, in order to not only select the best indicators for each specific case, as well as to provide multi-indicator consensus approaches that can be used to detect wildfire disturbances in space and time.</description>

      <description>Full abstract Geographic Object-based Image Analysis (GEOBIA) is increasingly used to process high-spatial resolution imagery, with applications ranging from single species detection to habitat and land cover mapping. Image segmentation plays a key role in GEOBIA workflows, allowing to partition images into homogenous and mutually exclusive regions. Nonetheless, segmentation techniques require a robust parameterization to achieve the best results. Frequently, inappropriate parameterization leads to sub-optimal results and difficulties in comparing distinct methods.</description>

      <title>Patterns of landscape seasonality influence passerine diversity: Implications for conservation management under global change</title>
      <link>http://joaogoncalves.cc/publication/2018_06_civantos_patterns_of_landscape_seasonality_influence_passerine_diversity/</link>

      <guid>http://joaogoncalves.cc/publication/2018_06_civantos_patterns_of_landscape_seasonality_influence_passerine_diversity/</guid>
      <description>Full abstract The importance of environmental heterogeneity for biodiversity across scales is widely recognized in ecological theory and profusely supported by evidence. However, our understanding of the effects of spatiotemporal patterns of landscape functional properties on biodiversity is still rather limited. We examined the relationship between common passerine species richness and ecosystem functioning dynamics, namely seasonality, measured by satellite remote sensing. We focused on rural landscapes of a mountain National Park in Portugal undergoing rapid reshaping from agro-pastoral mosaics to early successional landscapes.</description>

      <title>Towards functional biodiversity predictions: a hierarchical modelling framework from primary productivity to biomass of upper trophic levels</title>

      <guid>http://joaogoncalves.cc/publication/2018_12_bastos_towards_functional_biodiversity_predictions/</guid>
      <description>Full abstract Context Current shifts in biodiversity are driven by multiple processes of environmental and landscape change. Particularly, land use/land cover (LU/LC) dynamics are among the major drivers of biodiversity loss worldwide. Objectives In this study we aim to explore the applicability of a new modelling framework to predict top predators’ responses to LU/LC changes. Methods The framework integrates remote-sensing based predictors, statistical inference, stochastic-dynamic simulations and spatial projections in a common and interactive approach.</description>

      <title>Assessing the multi-scale predictive ability of ecosystem functional attributes for species distribution modelling</title>

      <description>Full abstract Global environmental changes are rapidly affecting species’ distributions and habitat suitability worldwide, requiring a continuous update of biodiversity status to support effective decisions on conservation policy and management. In this regard, satellite-derived Ecosystem Functional Attributes (EFAs) offer a more integrative and quicker evaluation of ecosystem responses to environmental drivers and changes than climate and structural or compositional landscape attributes. Thus, EFAs may hold advantages as predictors in Species Distribution Models (SDMs) and for implementing multi-scale species monitoring programs.</description>

      <title>Indicator-based assessment of post-fire recovery dynamics using satellite NDVI time-series</title>

      <description>Full abstract Fire disturbance severely modifies ecosystem structure and functioning, and therefore predicting post-fire responses is pivotal to improve land management. Indicators that efficiently link post-fire recovery with a timely decision on landscape management can play a key role in the governance of fire risk. We describe a framework to evaluate post-fire recovery based on remotely-sensed measures of relative vegetation recovery, calculated from satellite NDVI time-series. Three indicators are proposed: the novel Cumulative Relative Recovery Index (CRRI), measuring the (mid-long term) extent and completeness of recovery; the Recovery Trend Index (RTI), measuring the steepness of the mid-term post-fire recovery trend; and the Half Recovery Time index (HRT), a measure of the short-term recovery rate.</description>

      <title>Comparative landscape genetics of pond-breeding amphibians in Mediterranean temporal wetlands: The positive role of structural heterogeneity in promoting gene flow</title>
      <link>http://joaogoncalves.cc/publication/2017_07_gutierrez_et_al_comparative-landscape-genetics/</link>

      <description>Full abstract Comparative landscape genetics studies can provide key information to implement cost-effective conservation measures favoring a broad set of taxa. These studies are scarce, particularly in Mediterranean areas, which include diverse but threatened biological communities. Here we focus on Mediterranean wetlands in central Iberia and perform a multi-level, comparative study of two endemic pond-breeding amphibians, a salamander (Pleurodeles waltl) and a toad (Pelobates cultripes). We genotyped 411 salamanders from 20 populations and 306 toads from 16 populations at 18 and 16 microsatellite loci, respectively, and identified major factors associated with population connectivity through the analysis of three sets of variables potentially affecting gene flow at increasingly finer levels of spatial resolution.</description>

      <description>Full abstract Environmental changes are driving rapid geographic shifts of suitable environmental conditions for species. These might survive by tracking those shifts, however successful responses will depend on the spatial distribution of suitable habitats (current and future) and on their connectivity. Most herptiles (i.e., amphibians and reptiles) have low dispersal abilities, and therefore herptiles are among the most vulnerable groups to environmental changes. Here we assessed the vulnerability of herptile species to future climate and land use changes in fragmented landscapes.</description>

      <description>Full abstract Ongoing declines in biodiversity caused by global environmental changes call for adaptive conservation management, including the assessment of habitat suitability spatiotemporal dynamics potentially affecting species persistence. Remote sensing (RS) provides a wide-range of satellite-based environmental variables that can be fed into species distribution models (SDMs) to investigate species-environment relations and forecast responses to change. We address the spatiotemporal dynamics of species’ habitat suitability at the landscape level by combining multi-temporal RS data with SDMs for analysing inter-annual habitat suitability dynamics.</description>

      <description>Full abstract Question: Can very high-resolution colour orthophotography and digital surface models (DSMs) from an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) be effectively used for assessment of habitat extent and condition in fine-scale disturbance-dependent mosaics?
Location: Serra de Arga mountain range, a Natura 2000 protected site in the NW region of Portugal where drastic changes in pastoral activities have occurred over recent decades.
Methods: An UAV platform was used to collect very high-resolution (6 cm) images and to produce a DSM (10 cm).</description>
